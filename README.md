# 💰 Expense Tracker (CLI)

A **simple command-line expense tracker** built with **Python**.  
This project allows users to enter expenses, store them in a list, and calculate the **total amount spent**.  

This project was built as part of **Lists and Mini Productivity Tools** while learning Python fundamentals.

## 🚀 Features
- Add multiple expenses  
- Store expenses using Python **lists**  
- Calculate **total spending** using `sum()`  
- **Simple and beginner-friendly CLI interface**  
- Real-life practical use case
## 🧠 Concepts Learned
- Python **lists**  
- **User input** with `input()`  
- **Type conversion** (`float`)  
- Loops (`while`)  
- **Accumulation** with `sum()`  
- Building **CLI applications**  

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter expense amounts.  
2. Each expense is stored in a **list**.  
3. The user types `done` to stop entering expenses.  
4. The program calculates and displays:  
   - **All expenses entered**  
   - **Total amount spent**  

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/nathademola/expense-tracker.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd expense-tracker

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python expense_tracker.py

##  📸 Sample Output

Welcome to Expense Tracker

Enter an expense amount or type 'done' to finish: 1500

Enter an expense amount or type 'done' to finish: 300

Enter an expense amount or type 'done' to finish: done

Expense Summary

Expenses: [1500.0, 300.0]

Total Spent: ₦ 1800.0
